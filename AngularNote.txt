                                ---------------------------------------

                                        Basic Commands In Angular
                                      -----------------------------

                         1. To Create an Angular Project : ng new project-name
                         2. To run an Angular Project : ng serve
                         3. To generate component : ng g c component-name
                         4. To generate userdefined Service : ng g s service-folder/service-name
                         5. To generate build : ng build
                         6. To generate userdefined pipe : ng g p pipe-folder/pipe-name 

                                        Basic Concepts In Angular
                                     -------------------------------

                                1. Module - to import 3rd party libraries, also used to hold components, 
                                   Root Module : AppModule
                                2. Component - html,css,ts also have a selector, 
                                   Root Component : AppComponent
                                3. Selector - to replace the selector tag with its html page
                                4. Decorator - to hold meta data , Starts with @   
                                5. Set up path for component - to view a component in another webpage  
                                    - Use app.routing.module.ts    
                                    - Use router-outlet selector in root component(AppComponent) - To navigate according to the user requested page      
                                    - routerLink - used to redirect from one page to another
                                6. Data Binding - Data sharing within a component
                                    - One way Binding : Data sharing in one direction
                                       - ts (component) to html file (view)
                                          - String Interpolation : {{class property-name}}   
                                          - Property Binding : [attribute-name]="class property-name" 
                                       - html (view) to ts (component)
                                          - Event Binding : (event-name)="function call" 
                                          - Event Binding using $event : (event-name)="function name($event)"
                                          - Event Binding using template reference variable : #variable-name
                                    - Two way Binding : Data sharing in both direction
                                             - ngModel: import FormsModule in AppModule
                                                   [(ngModel)]="class property"  
                                       - Angular Forms
                                          - Template Driven Forms
                                          - Model Driven Forms    
                                8. Dependency Injection : To share data between dependent classes    
                                    - constructor(access-specifier variable-name:Class Name){
                                    } 
                                9. Angular Services
                                10. Angular Directives : DOM Manipulation
                                    = Component Directive
                                    = Structural Directive : to add/remove html items
                                       - *ngIf = "condition"
                                       - *ngFor = "let variable-name of array-name" 
                                    - Attribute Directive : to apply style to html elements
                                       - ngClass     
                                    -  ngForm    
                                11. Parant Child data sharing
                                    - Child to Parent communication : @Output decorator 
                                    - Parent to Child communication : @Input decorator 
                                12. Asynchronous function handling in angular
                                 - Using RxJS - (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) library
                                    - Use Observable to resolve Asynchronous functions
                                       - resolve state : subscribe(observer:object) 
                                          - observer can be next: required, where we get 200 response code
                                          - error optional   
                                       - reject state : catchError(callback)
                                          - error():to get error response when you subscribe it 
                                13. Api call using Angular : HttpClient Class (have all http methods)
                                    - import HttpClientModule in AppModule
                                14. ActivatedRoute: Provides access to information about a route associated with a component that is loaded in an outlet.
                                15. Pipes : Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display.
                                    Syntax :
                                    value_expression | pipe-operator [ : option1 [ : option2 [ : option3 ] ] ]
